# Designbase

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Designbase is a repository for collecting and analyzing qualitative user
research. Load transcripts, highlight key statements, then tag and organize
them into insights.

## Project goals

There are many fine commercial products for organizing one's UX research,
from flexible & generic webapps to fully professional-grade QDAS systems.
If any of these satisfy your needs, use them by all means!

* Airtable
* NomNom
* etc.

This project, however, aims to achieve a specific set of goals:

* Free and open source
* Productively usable
* Compatible with the techniques I learned from Adaptive Path, by which one highlights the actions, challenges, and emotions found in interview transcripts and then clusters those highlights into insights suitable for personas and process maps.

## Software requirements

This application requires:

- Ruby 2.5.3
- Rails 5.2.1
- PostgreSQL
