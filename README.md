Designbase is a repository for collecting and analyzing qualitative user
research. Load transcripts, highlight key statements, then tag and organize
them into insights.

## Project goals & constraints

There are many fine commercial products for organizing one's UX research,
from flexible & generic webapps to fully professional-grade QDAS systems.
If any of these satisfy your needs, use them by all means!

* [Airtable](https://airtable.com/), specifically the [Polaris](https://airtable.com/universe/expShuhNMi0Oc0xpb/polaris-ux-nuggets) base
* [NomNom](https://nomnominsights.com/)
* [Aurelius](https://www.aureliuslab.com/product)

Other open-source solutions may also fit your bill:

* [Mosaiq](https://github.com/NasdaqDesign/Mosaiq) (requires WordPress)

Designbase, however, aims to achieve a specific set of goals:

* Free and open source
* Productively usable
* Compatible with Adaptive Path's research techniques, in which one highlights the actions, challenges, and emotions found in interview transcripts and then clusters those highlights into insights suitable for personas and process maps.

In addition, the project is built with this set of constraints:

* No authentication & authorization functions within the app: ANGTFT. (Need privacy? Run your server on an internal network, or use HTTP authentication.)

## Software requirements

- Ruby 2.5.3
